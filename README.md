SN-Pico--we employed a pre-developed SN machine, which utilizes parameters such as SN declarations and pin mappings presented in the form of C language `.h` files, generated by the file `sparse-generator.c`. We used a variant of the SN virtual machine for GPU, replacing certain multidimensional grid structures with the corresponding (nested) loops. To fit the limited memory of microcontrollers, we adopted a specialized Indexed Column-Wise Sparse Matrix (`sicw`) data structure and used arrays to store priorities to accelerate retrieval. Compared to conventional matrix-based implementations, this structure reduces memory usage and enhances performance. In practical applications, we used the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and employed the Arduino IDE as the central tool to test and evaluate the performance of the microcontroller.
