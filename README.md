`SN-Pico`--we employed a pre-developed SN machine, which utilizes parameters such as `SN` declarations and pin mappings presented in the form of C language `.h` files, generated by the file `sparse-generator.c`. We used a variant of the `SN` virtual machine for `GPU`, replacing certain multidimensional grid structures with the corresponding (nested) loops. To fit the limited memory of microcontrollers, we adopted a specialized Indexed Column-Wise Sparse Matrix (`sicw`) data structure and used arrays to store priorities to accelerate retrieval. Compared to conventional matrix-based implementations, this structure reduces memory usage and enhances performance. In practical applications, we used the `Raspberry Pi Pico` microcontroller and employed the `Arduino IDE` as the central tool to test and evaluate the performance of the microcontroller.

How to use `NDRtoSN` as a part of experimental `SNC IDE&VM`
-----
We list references to components in the "Compatibility" section.
> 1. Use `Tina` `nd` as a graphical editor and its labels with special syntax (see "Transition Substitution Label" section) to specify the transition substitution of `HSN`.  
> 2. Use `NDRtoSN` to convert the `NDR` file from `Tina` into `HSN` or `LSN`.  
> 3. Use `HSNtoLSN` to compile and link the HSN file with the mentioned LSN files into a single `LSN` file.  
> 4. Run the `LSN` file on `SN-VM` or `SN-VM-GPU`.
